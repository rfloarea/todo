# Todo App
A simple app for tracking your todos.

## Build Priorities
1. Accessibility
    - keyboard navigable (as well as by mouse)
    - logical, non-redundant reading from screenreaders
    - responsive down to the smallest screens (around 320px wide)
    - small file sizes for low-end devices and slow networks
    - low to no animation
    - light and dark mode (WCAG AA contrast on both)
2. Tinker-able
    - clear, easily observable code with many comments

## Tools and Tech
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- VSCode
- Firefox DevTools (primarily the 'Accessibility' feature)
- [WebAIM's WCAG 2 Checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist)

The goal here is to just get a very simple little app for people to use to jot down those pesky todos that pile up. I want to experience to feel smooth, especially for keyboard-only users.

I'm an aspiring keyboard-only user, but that is by choice.
