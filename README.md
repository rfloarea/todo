# Todo App
A simple app for tracking your todos.

## Build Priorities
1. Accessibility
    - keyboard navigable (as well as by mouse)
    - logical, non-redundant reading from screenreaders
    - responsive down to the smallest screens (around 320px wide)
    - small file sizes for low-end devices and slow networks
    - low to no animation
    - light and dark mode (WCAG AA contrast on both)
2. Tinker-able
    - clear, easily observable code with many comments

## Tools and Tech
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- VSCode
- Firefox DevTools (primarily the 'Accessibility' feature)
- [WebAIM's WCAG 2 Checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist)

The goal here is to just get a very simple little app for people to use to jot down those pesky todos that pile up. I want to experience to feel smooth, especially for keyboard-only users.

I'm an aspiring keyboard-only user, but that is by choice.

This is a super fun project! Low stakes, but I'm learning a ton!

It's done!! I'm super happy with how this came out. There were a surprising amount of "little" things - dark mode, icons, spacing, alignment, etc. 

What did we learn from all this? It takes a considerable amount of attention to detail to create even the most minimally accessible web app. This isn't to say it's not worth it. Not at all! Just that it's a mindset I'll need to consciously hone until it becomes second nature. It's definitely a muscle I want to develop.

This has got me thinking of creating a series of little web apps called "single file apps" where all the code lives in one single file. There's something about that idea that draws me in. I like the idea of having all the code in one place to make something that's actually useful. 

For instance, I've printed the code for this app onto actual paper. And something about that make's it feel so real, so tangible, so manageable. Creating complete apps that are comprehensible to humans, a *single* human, is appealing to me. It makes it feel like software can be something you can trade like a book or playing cards or something. It makes it feel like something average people can have casual conversations about over tea. That would be cool - if code, actual code, was commonplace in casual conversation.
